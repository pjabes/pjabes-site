      <description>Introduction If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this post, you likely know of the SANS course and associated GIAC certification. You&amp;rsquo;re likely about to sit your course and/or exam and are looking for some tips and tricks to maximise the amount of value you get out of this eye-wateringly expensive course. This post is an overview of the tips and tricks that I have for smashing your SANS GIAC experience.
At time of writing, I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to undertake FOR508: Advanced Incident Response, Threat Hunting, and Digital Forensics and SEC511: Continuous Monitoring and Security Operations and successfully pass both associated exams to become GCFA and GMON certified.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of hype with Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) and on paper it basically sells itself. A product that improves Time To Respond (TTR) metrics whilst decreasing FTE count is a CISO&amp;rsquo;s wet dream. But unfortunately, many orgs find it difficult to realise value with their SOAR products and in a way are soaring by the seat of their pants.
This blog post provides some (no marketting) recommendations on how you can realise the most value from your SOAR investment.</description>

      <description>An assortment of career-related posts that I found to be thought-provoking (but I should note that I do not necessarily agree with all of these).
  You are not an employee, you are a business.
It&amp;rsquo;s not personal; it&amp;rsquo;s business.
  How to waste your career, one comfortable year at a time
Apoorva (apoorvagovind) provides a framework for evaluating when we are being complacent and the realisation of the true cost of this.</description>
