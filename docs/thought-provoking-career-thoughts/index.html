<h1>thought-provoking career thoughts</h1>

  <p>An assortment of career-related posts that I found to be thought-provoking (but I should note that I do not necessarily agree with all of these).</p>

<p><em><a href="https://theskip.substack.com/p/stage-of-company-not-name-of-company">Stage of company, not name of company</a></em><br>
TheSkip (<a href="https://theskip.substack.com">@theskip</a>) contend that it is not the name of the company that matters for overall job satisfaction, but also the stage of the comapny (product fit, hypergrowth, scale, etc).</p>
