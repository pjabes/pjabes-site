      <description>Introduction If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this post, you likely know of the SANS course and associated GIAC certification. You&amp;rsquo;re likely about to sit your course and/or exam and are looking for some tips and tricks to maximise the amount of value you get out of this eye-wateringly expensive course. This post is an overview of the tips and tricks that I have for smashing your SANS GIAC experience.
At time of writing, I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to undertake FOR508: Advanced Incident Response, Threat Hunting, and Digital Forensics and SEC511: Continuous Monitoring and Security Operations and successfully pass both associated exams to become GCFA and GMON certified.</description>
