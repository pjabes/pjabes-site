A working draft of some things that I have done for my home assistant installation. 

* VLAN all IOT devices.
* Leveraging the Unifi Switch, Pfsense and VLANs I have segregated all of the IOT devices into their own environment.
* Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNdP1JKwtGQ


* Where possible, leverage lcoal connections.  This can be done through unsupported libraries, so it may be a good diea to do a sourcedoe review.
