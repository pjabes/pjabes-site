Many Security Operation Centres will assume that playbook development could (or should) solely be completed by security analysts.  While it is difficult to narrow down exactly where this comes from; I suspect it comes from vendor's marketing the ease of use of their solutions and the inclusion of WYSIWYG and drag and drop editors. 

Whilst it is possible for security analysts to create functioning instances of playbooks many SOCs will encounter difficulties scaling this approach and thus hindering the value realisation of the products.   SOAR Playbooks are better related to "devops software products" than security scripts and once one considers the amount of engineering rigour and talent that goes behind managing testing, technical debt, support and user experience it becomes clear why SOC analysts should not be solely in charge of playbook development.  Adding the rigour and talent required to develop scalable playbooks will result in the very thing that SOAR aims to reduce; SOC fatigue. 

If I was to be building the dream team, I'd be looking for the following skills:
* *SOC Analysts Skills* - SOC Analysts need to be involved throughout the playbook development phase and act as SMEs for these software products. Without active participation, it is likely that the resultant products will be misaligned with the end users.  

* *Software Engineering Skills* - These people bring the engineering know-how on building production-ready code.  Involving them early in the project will save headaches down the track by ensuring that the framework to build playbooks is architectually sound and scalable. 

* *Business Analysts (Process Improvers)* - Remembering that doing an inefficient process quickly is still inefficient, it may be worth involving a business analyst to undertake some process optimisation and seeking the most "bang for buck" in playbook candidate selection, etc.  

Finding individuals that poses all of the skills can be difficult (see: expensive).  So get creative - perhaps you could partner with the business to second resources or look to leverage people aiming to make a transition into security.

### SOARing by the seat of your pants
There's a lot of hype with Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) and on paper it basically sells itself.  A product that improves Time To Respond (TTR), decreases FTE count and improves job satisfaction is a CISO's wet dream.  But unfortunately, many orgs find it difficult to realise value with their SOAR products and in a way are **soaring by the seat of their pants**. 

This [microblog series](https://pabes.me/tags/soar/) provides some actionable thoughts about how you could enable faster value realisation with your investment.
